# libgollatz

`libgollatz` is a library for running the [Collatz conjecture algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). That's literally it. I'm using this to cement my understanding of packaging libraries in Go. I'm only putting it on GitHub because I'm creating another [project](https://github.com/b4ux1t3/go-rest-api) that uses this as a dependancy.
